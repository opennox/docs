## Troubleshooting

### OpenNox doesn't start
- Try starting OpenNox from the terminal. Check if there are any error messages there.
- Make sure you have put binaries into your Nox installation folder or have game files in the `$HOME/Nox` directory or in the place specified in `opennox.yml` (which can be either in `$HOME/.config/opennox` or in the working directory used to call binaries from):
```yaml
game:
  data: /home/user/some/path/to/Nox
```

Change this path manually to a folder where your copy of Nox is installed, if necessary. Restart OpenNox.

If nothing helps, please contact us on [OpenNox Discord](https://discord.gg/HgDUeXhAyW) in `#feedback` channel and share the `opennox.log` located in the `$HOME/snap/opennox/common/logs` folder.

### Can't connect to a server: Version mismatch

HD and legacy versions won't join servers of the opposite version.

Most online servers still run legacy version, so if you want to join them, you must run legacy version of OpenNox as well.
