This documentation covers NoxScript runtime implemented in OpenNox.

## Runtimes

Currently, the list of supported script runtimes includes:

- [NoxScript 3 (aka NS3)]({{% relref "noxscript/ns3" %}}) - compatible with original [NoxScript 3](https://noxtools.github.io/noxscript/)
- [EUD v171]({{% relref "noxscript/eud" %}}) - compatible with Panic's [EUD project](https://gitlab.com/happysoft3/eud-maps-project/-/tree/master/eud_project/libs) (*work-in-progress*)
- [NoxScript 4 (aka NS4)]({{% relref "noxscript/ns4" %}}) - our new script runtime (**recommended**)

For a quick guide on using NoxScript, see [quickstart]({{% relref "noxscript/start" %}}).

Some of your questions may be answered already in [Q&A](./docs/questions-and-answers.md).
There are [examples]({{% relref "noxscript/examples" %}}) available as well.
